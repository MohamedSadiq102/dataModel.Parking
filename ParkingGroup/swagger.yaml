      A group of parking spots. Granularity level can vary. It can be an storey on a parking garage, 
      an specific zone belonging to a big parking lot, or just a group of spots intended for parking a certain vehicle type or
      subject to certain restrictions (disabled, residents, ...).
      For the sake of simplicity only one vehicle type per parking group is allowed. Similarly,
      one required permit is only allowed per group type.
