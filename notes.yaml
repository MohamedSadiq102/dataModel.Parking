notesPrevious:
  These data models are intended to model entities relevant for parking use cases
  in smart cities scenarios. When feasible these models reuse types, properties
  and enumerations from
  [DATEX II version 2.3](http://www.datex2.eu/content/parking-publications-extension-v10a).
  A data dictionary for DATEX II terms can be found at
  [http://datexbrowser.tamtamresearch.com/](http://datexbrowser.tamtamresearch.com/).

  Nonetheless, these data models are intended to NGSI-based systems and many
  simplifications has been made with respect to DATEX II version 2.3.
